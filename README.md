# Google Map Project titled Rocky Mountain High

This project displays a map of the Colorado summit area ski resorts along with some local
taverns and marijuana dispensaries.  It allows you to narrow the markers displayed using
a general search/filter as well as using icons to display only locations belonging to one
of the above categories.  A list of the displayed locations shows along the right margin.
Clicking on any of these locations or associated map markers will bring up a Google Maps
Info Window containing the name of the location, a link to the location website and a button
that can be used to get a detailed weather report for a city nearby the selected location.
The weather report comes from Weather Underground and shows the current conditions for the
nearby city.  It also provides a link used to provide a Weather Underground forecast for
the city selected.
